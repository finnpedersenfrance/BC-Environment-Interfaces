# How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to Fork this project and improve the functionality. 

Since this code was written for an older version BC, there is probably room for improvement. 


Areas for improvement could be 

- Actions on pages and the related functions
- More Automated Tests for these functions


Make sure that your functions
- are easy to read and understand, 
- have good names for variables, 
- are robust, 
- are easy to maintain, and
- are of general interest.
